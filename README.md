   <h1>Web Development</h1> 
   <P>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide  Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple  single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social  network services. <i>“A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly  refers, may include <span style="color: red;">Web engineering</span>, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,  client-side/server-side scripting, <font style="color: red;">Web server</font> and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.”</i><br><br>
    Among Web professionals, <b>"Web development" </b>usually refers to the main non-design aspects  of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content  management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical  skills. <br><br>
    For larger organizations and businesses,<span style="color:yellow">Web development</span> teams can consist of hundreds of  people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while  developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or  contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic  designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort  between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds  of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack  developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user  browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the  Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever. <br><br>

    <h1>Poem</h1>
    <p><pre>
        You may write me down in history
        With your bitter, twisted lies, 
        You may trod me in the very dirt
        But still, like dust, I’ll rise. 

        You may shoot me with your words, 
        You may cut me with your eyes, 
        You may kill me with your hatefulness,
        But still, like air, I’ll rise. 

        Out of the huts of history’s shame I rise 
        Up from a past that’s rooted in pain I rise 
        I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide, 
        Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. 

        Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
        I rise 
        Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
        I rise 
        Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, 
        I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
        I rise 
        I rise 
        I rise.
